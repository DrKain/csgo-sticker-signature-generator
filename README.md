### Abandoned, Sorry.

> Unfortunately this project is no-longer being updated. When I originally made this in 2015 it was simply an experiment and exploration into the HTML5 canvas. The popularity on Reddit generated *millions* of site hits in just a few months so there was motivation to update the generator with new events and such.  
> After a few years the popularity died out and while there's still thousands of people using these as avatars, there's not enough demand for me to sink time into updating this project.
